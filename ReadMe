Team, Course Project

Developed a web application of filtering, recommending and searching local restaurants.
Built the recommendation system by analyzing the keywords frequency of the collected comments.
Used MongoDB and Hadoop to store informations as distribution data.

This is half of the whole project. Basic Front-End and didn't include hadoop.
Another team member and I finished the back-end part and the database, which is in this repository. 
And two other team members took responsibilities of hadoop and front-end. 
We used their computer to combine this two parts. Thus I don't have their code after three years.
